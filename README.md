The bell's culture is a secular tradition strongly linked to the religious and social activities of the old Brazilian's villages. 
In São João del-Rei, where the singular bell tradition composes the soundscape of the city, the bell's ringing created from different rhythmic and timbral patterns, establish a language capable of transmitting varied types of messages to the local population.
In this way, the social function of these ringing, added to real or legendary facts related to the bell's culture, were able to produce affections and to constitute a strong relation with the identity of the community.
The link of this community with the bells, therefore transcends the man-object relationship, tending to an interpersonal relationship practically.

Thus, to emphasize this connection in an artistic way, it is proposed the installation called: PER(SINO)FICAÇÂO.

In this installation, the public is invited to enter a booth in order to represent a bell in the city.
In the cabin, some projections of different towers and bells from the city's churches are projected.
Until then, a calm soundscape of the city is the only sound reproduced.
Upon entering the booth, the height and width of the participant are captured, which when pressing a button, triggers the sound synthesis of a certain bell with different patterns and rhythms, completing the soundscape.

The nature of the composition varies according to the characteristics of the visitor.
These characteristics are captured through a webcam that uses Computer Vision algorithms, which then maps the information collected to create a new bell, based on the sound synthesis.
It is worth mentioning that the participant, according to the gesture performed, can drastically change the generated timbre.
